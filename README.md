# CafeManagement
## Who are the users of the software?
The users of the software would be cashiers at a cafe that need to ring up an order.
## What is the purpose of the software?
The purpose of the software is to make it easy for customer totals to be calculated, similar to a simplified POS system.
## Where and when will the software be used?
The software will be used at cafes and smaller restaurants, where fast customer totals and less menu items are required.
## How does the software work?
The software asks for a username and password, and once submitted it will pull up a screen that has different options for food and drink options that can be selected, added to a bill, taxed, and have the final receipt displayed.
## Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?
My software could be beneficial to simplify POS in a more intuitive and easy-to-use format. Many current POS systems are not very intuitive, which makes it harder for less tech-savvy people and new employees to get the hang of it.
